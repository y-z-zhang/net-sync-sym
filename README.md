# Finest simultaneous block diagonalization of multiple matrices

This is the MATLAB code accompanying the paper: Y. Zhang and A. E. Motter, _Symmetry-independent stability analysis of synchronization patterns_, [SIAM Rev. 62 817â€“836 (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1137/19M127358X).
A related algorithm (implemented in Python) can be found [here](https://github.com/y-z-zhang/SBD).

It includes:
1. sbd_fast.m

  Implementation of the SBD algorithm (Algorithm 1 in the paper), which finds the finest simultaneous block diagonalization of any given set of symmetric matrices. The algorithm works by sequentially exploring invariant subspaces under matrix multiplications.

2. examples.m

  Examples showing applications of the SBD algorithm in analyzing network synchronization patterns, including patterns arising from symmetry clusters, Laplacian clusters, input clusters, and chimera states in multilayer networks.

3. lbmap.m

  Colormap file used for the plots in examples.m. Blue corresponds to positive values and red to negative values.

4. random_net.txt

  The adjacency matrix of the 30-node random network used in examples.m.
